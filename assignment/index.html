      <ul>
        <li>Do my nested conditionals look ok from a visual perspective, or is there a better SOP?</li>
        <li>I think I used a cheat to get the space between my firstName and lastName for fullName. What's the better way?</li>
        <li>I want to better understand different ways to do Q16! More specifically, like what's the SOP we follow to code something , especially as beginners... do we make it as long as seems necessary and then see if it can be more concise, or?</li>
        <li>What habits should we be trying to instill now re: adding spaces or not between symbols, and visual appearance of code lines in general? Obvs some of that is personal preference but maybe there's some broad advice.</li>
      </ul>
